<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 20<br><br>
</b>

Give up learning, and put an end to your troubles.<br><br>

Is there a difference between yes and no?<br>
Is there a difference between good and evil?<br>
Must I fear what others fear? What nonsense!<br>
Other people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox.<br>
In spring some go to the park, and climb the terrace,<br>
But I alone am drifting not knowing where I am.<br>
Like a new-born babe before it learns to smile,<br>
I am alone, without a place to go.<br><br>

Other have more than they need, but I alone have nothing.<br>
I am a fool. Oh, yes! I am confused.<br>
Other men are clear and bright,<br>
But I alone am dim and weak.<br>
Other men are sharp and clever,<br>
But I alone am dull and stupid.<br>
Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea.<br>
Without direction, like the restless wind.<br><br>

Everyone else is busy,<br>
But I alone am aimless and depressed.<br>
I am different.<br>
I am nourished by the great mother.<br><br><br>
