<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 54<br><br>
</b>

What is firmly established cannot be uprooted.<br>
What is firmly grasped cannot slip away.<br>
It will be honoured from generation to generation.<br><br>

Cultivate Virtue in yourself,<br>
And Virtue will be real.<br>
Cultivate it in the family,<br>
And Virtue will abound.<br>
Cultivate it in the village,<br>
And Virtue will grow.<br>
Cultivate it in the nation,<br>
And Virtue will be abundant.<br>
Cultivate it in the universe,<br>
And Virtue will be everywhere.<br><br>

Therefore look at the body as body;<br>
Look at the family as family;<br>
Look at the village as village;<br>
Look at the nation as nation;<br>
Look at the universe as universe.<br><br>

How do I know the universe is like this?<br>
By looking!<br><br><br>
