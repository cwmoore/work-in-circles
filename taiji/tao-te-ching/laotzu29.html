<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 29<br><br>
</b>

Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?<br>
I do not believe it can be done.<br><br>

The universe is sacred.<br>
You cannot improve it.<br>
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.<br>
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.<br><br>

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;<br>
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;<br>
Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;<br>
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.<br><br>

Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
