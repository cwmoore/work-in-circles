<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 14<br><br>
</b>

Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form.<br>
Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound.<br>
Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible.<br>
These three are indefinable;<br>
Therefore they are joined in one.<br><br>

From above it is not bright;<br>
From below it is not dark:<br>
An unbroken thread beyond description.<br>
It returns to nothingness.<br>
The form of the formless,<br>
The image of the imageless,<br>
It is called indefinable and beyond imagination.<br><br>

Stand before it and there is no beginning.<br>
Follow it and there is no end.<br>
Stay with the ancient Tao,<br>
Move with the present.<br><br>

Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.<br><br><br>
