<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 41<br><br>
</b>

The wise student hears of the Tao and practises it diligently.<br>
The average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and again.<br>
The foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud.<br>
If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is.<br><br>

Hence it is said:<br>
The bright path seems dim;<br>
Going forward seems like retreat;<br>
The easy way seems hard;<br>
The highest Virtue seems empty;<br>
Great purity seems sullied;<br>
A wealth of Virtue seems inadequate;<br>
The strength of Virtue seems frail;<br>
Real Virtue seems unreal;<br>
The perfect square has no corners;<br>
Great talents ripen late;<br>
The highest notes are hard to hear;<br>
The greatest form has no shape.<br>
The Tao is hidden and without name.<br>
The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.<br><br><br>
