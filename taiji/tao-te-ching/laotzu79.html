<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 79<br><br>
</b>

After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.<br>
What can one do about it?<br>
Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain<br>
But does not exact his due.<br>
A man of Virtue performs his part,<br>
But a man without Virtue requires others to fulfil their obligations.<br>
The Tao of heaven is impartial.<br>
It stays with good men all the time.<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
