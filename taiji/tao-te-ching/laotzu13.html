<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 13<br><br>
</b>

Accept disgrace willingly.<br>
Accept misfortune as the human condition.<br><br>

What do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"?<br>
Accept being unimportant.<br>
Do not be concerned with loss and gain.<br>
This is called "accepting disgrace willingly."<br><br>

What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"?<br>
Misfortune comes from having a body.<br>
Without a body, how could there be misfortune?<br><br>

Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.<br>
Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.<br><br><br>
