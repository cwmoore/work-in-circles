<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 34<br><br>
</b>

The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the right and to the left.<br>
The ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back.<br>
It fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim.<br><br>

It nourishes the ten thousand things,<br>
And yet is not their lord.<br>
It has no aim; it is very small.<br><br>

The ten thousand things return to it,<br>
Yet it is not their lord.<br>
It is very great.<br><br>

It does not show greatness,<br>
And is therefore really great.<br><br><br>
