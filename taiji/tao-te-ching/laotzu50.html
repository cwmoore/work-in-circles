<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 50<br><br>
</b>

Between birth and death,<br>
Three in ten are following life,<br>
Three in ten are following death,<br>
And men just passing from birth to death also number three in ten.<br>
Why is this so?<br>
Because they live their lives on the gross level.<br><br>

He who knows how to live can walk abroad<br>
Without fear of rhinoceros or tiger.<br>
He will not be wounded in battle.<br>
For in him rhinoceroses can find no place to thrust their horn,<br>
Tigers can find no place to use their claws,<br>
And weapons no place to pierce.<br>
Why is this so?
Because he has no place for death to enter.<br><br><br>
