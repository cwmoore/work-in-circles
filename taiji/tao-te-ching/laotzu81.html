<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 81<br><br>
</b>

Truthful words are not beautiful.<br>
Beautiful words are not truthful.<br>
Good men do not argue.<br>
Those who argue are not good.<br>
Those who know are not learned.<br>
The learned do not know.<br><br>

The sage never tries to store things up.<br>
The more he does for others, the more he has.<br>
The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance.<br>
The Tao of heaven is pointed but does no harm.<br>
The Tao of the sage is work without effort.<br><br><br>
