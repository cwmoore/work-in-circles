Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 55<br><br>
</b>

He who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child.<br>
Wasps and serpents will not sting him;<br>
Wild beasts will not pounce upon him;<br>
He will not be attacked by birds of prey.<br>
His bones are soft, his muscles weak,<br>
But his grip is firm.<br>
He has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole.<br>
His manhood is strong.<br>
He screams all day without becoming hoarse.<br>
This is perfect harmony.<br><br>

Knowing harmony is constancy.<br>
Knowing constancy is enlightenment.<br><br>

It is not wise to rush about.<br>
Controlling the breath causes strain.<br>
If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.<br>
This is not the way of Tao.<br>
Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.<br><br><br>
