<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 30<br><br>
</b>

Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao,<br>
Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.<br>
For this would only cause resistance.<br>
Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed.<br>
Lean years follow in the wake of a great war.<br>
Just do what needs to be done.<br>
Never take advantage of power.<br><br>

Achieve results,<br>
But never glory in them.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
But never boast.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
But never be proud.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
Because this is the natural way.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
But not through violence.<br><br>

Force is followed by loss of strength.<br>
This is not the way of Tao.<br>
That which goes against the Tao<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;comes to an early end.<br><br><br>
