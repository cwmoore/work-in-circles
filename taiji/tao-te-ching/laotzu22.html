<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 22<br><br>
</b>

Yield and overcome;<br>
Bend and be straight;<br>
Empty and be full;<br>
Wear out and be new;<br>
Have little and gain;<br>
Have much and be confused.<br><br>

Therefore wise men embrace the one<br>
And set an example to all.<br>
Not putting on a display,<br>
They shine forth.<br>
Not justifying themselves,<br>
They are distinguished.<br>
Not boasting,<br>
They receive recognition.<br>
Not bragging,<br>
They never falter.<br>
They do not quarrel,<br>
So no one quarrels with them.<br>
Therefore the ancients say, 'Yield and overcome.'<br>
Is that an empty saying?<br>
Be really whole,<br>
And all things will come to you.<br><br><br>
