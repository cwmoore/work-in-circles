<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 61<br><br>
</b>

A great country is like low land.<br>
It is the meeting ground of the universe,<br>
The mother of the universe.<br><br>

The female overcomes the male with stillness,<br>
Lying low in stillness.<br><br>

Therefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country,<br>
It will conquer the smaller country.<br>
And if a small country submits to a great country,<br>
It can conquer the great country.<br>
Therefore those that would conquer must yield,<br>
And those that conquer do so because they yield.<br><br>

A great nation needs more people;<br>
A small country needs to serve.<br>
Each gets what it wants.<br>
It is fitting for a great nation to yield.<br><br><br>
