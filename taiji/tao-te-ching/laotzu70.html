<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 70<br><br>
</b>

My words are easy to understand and easy to perform,<br>
Yet no one under heaven knows them or practices them.<br><br>

My words have ancient beginnings.<br>
My actions are disciplined.<br>
Because men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.<br><br>

Those that know me are few;<br>
Those that abuse me are honoured.<br>
Therefore the sage wears rough clothing and holds the jewel in his heart.<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
