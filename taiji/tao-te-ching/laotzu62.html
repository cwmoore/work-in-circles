<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 62<br><br>
</b>

Tao is the source of the ten thousand things.<br>
It is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad.<br>
Sweet words can buy honour;<br>
Good deeds can gain respect.<br>
If a man is bad, do not abandon him.<br>
Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,<br>
Or the three officers of state installed,<br>
Do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses,<br>
But remain still and offered the Tao.<br>
Why does everyone like the Tao so much at first?<br>
Isn't it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin?<br>
Therefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.<br><br><br>
