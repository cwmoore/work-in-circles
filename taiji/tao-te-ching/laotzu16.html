Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 16<br><br>
</b>

Empty yourself of everything.<br>
Let the mind rest at peace.<br>
The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.<br>
They grow and flourish and then return to the source.<br>
Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.<br>
The way of nature is unchanging.<br>
Knowing constancy is insight.<br>
Not knowing constancy leads to disaster.<br>
Knowing constancy, the mind is open.<br>
With an open mind, you will be openhearted.<br>
Being openhearted, you will act royally.<br>
Being royal, you will attain the divine.<br>
Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao.<br>
Being at one with the Tao is eternal.<br>
And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.<br><br><br>
