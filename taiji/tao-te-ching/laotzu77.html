<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 77<br><br>
</b>

The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow.<br>
The high is lowered, and the low is raised.<br>
If the string is too long, it is shortened;<br>
If there is not enough, it is made longer.<br><br>

The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;and give to those who do not have enough.<br>
Man's way is different.<br>
He takes from those who do not have enough<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;to give to those who already have too much.<br>
What man has more than enough and gives it to the world?<br>
Only the man of Tao.<br><br>

Therefore the sage works without recognition.<br>
He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it.<br>
He does not try to show his knowledge.<br><br><br>
