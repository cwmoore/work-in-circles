<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 44<br><br>
</b>

Fame or self: Which matters more?<br>
Self or wealth: Which is more precious?<br>
Gain is loss; Which is more painful?<br><br>

He who is attached to things will suffer much.<br>
He who saves will suffer heavy loss.<br>
A contented man is never disappointed.<br>
He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.<br>
He will stay for ever safe.<br><br><br>
