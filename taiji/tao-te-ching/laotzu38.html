<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 38<br><br>
</b>

A truly good man is not aware of his goodness,<br>
And is therefore good.<br>
A foolish man tries to be good,<br>
And is therefore not good.<br><br>

A truly good man does nothing,<br>
Yet nothing is left undone.<br>
A foolish man is always doing,<br>
Yet much remains to be done<br><br>

When a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone.<br>
When a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done.<br>
When a disciplinarian does something and no one responds,<br>
He rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order<br><br>

Therefore when Tao is lost, there is goodness.<br>
When goodness is lost, there is kindness.<br>
When kindness is lost, there is justice.<br>
When justice is lost, there is ritual.<br>
Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion.<br>
Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of the Tao.<br>
It is the beginning of folly.<br><br>

Therefore the truly great man dwells on what is real<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;and not what is on the surface,<br>
On the fruit and not the flower,<br>
Therefore accept the one and reject the other.<br><br><br>
