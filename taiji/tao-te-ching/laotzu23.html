<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 23<br><br>
</b>

To talk little is natural.<br>
High winds do not last all morning.<br>
Heavy rain does not last all day.<br>
Why is this? Heaven and earth!<br>
If heaven and earth cannot make things eternal,<br>
How is it possible for man?<br><br>

He who follows the Tao<br>
is at one with the Tao.<br>
He who is virtuous<br>
Experiences Virtue.<br>
He who loses the way<br>
Feels lost.<br>
When you are at one with the Tao,<br>
The Tao welcomes you.<br>
When you are one with Virtue,<br>
The Virtue is always there.<br>
When you are at one with loss,<br>
The loss is experienced willingly.<br><br>

He who does not trust enough<br>
Will not be trusted.<br><br><br>
