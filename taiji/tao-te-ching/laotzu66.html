<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 66<br><br>
</b>

Why is the sea king of a hundred streams?<br>
Because it lies below them.<br>
Therefore it is the king of a hundred streams.<br><br>

If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility.<br>
If he would lead them, he must follow behind.<br>
In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed;<br>
When he stands before them, they will not be harmed.<br>
The whole world will support him and will not tire of him.<br><br>

Because he does not compete,<br>
He does not meet competition.<br><br><br>
