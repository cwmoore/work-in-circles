<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 15<br><br>
</b>

The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive.<br>
The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable.<br>
Because it is unfathomable,<br>
All we can do is describe their appearance.<br>
Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream.<br>
Alert, like men aware of danger.<br>
Courteous, like visiting guests.<br>
Yielding, like ice about to melt.<br>
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.<br>
Hollow, like caves.<br>
Opaque, like muddy pools.<br><br>

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?<br>
Who can remain still until the moment of action?<br>
Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfilment.<br>
Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.<br><br><br>
