<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 67<br><br>
</b>

Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare.<br>
Because it is great, it seems different.<br>
If it were not different, it would have vanished long ago.<br><br>

I have three treasures which I hold and keep.<br>
The first is mercy; the second is economy;<br>
The third is daring not to be ahead of others.<br>
From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;<br>
From humility comes leadership.<br><br>

Nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;<br>
They abandon economy, but try to be generous;<br>
They do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.<br>
This is certain death.<br><br>

Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.<br>
It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.<br><br><br>
