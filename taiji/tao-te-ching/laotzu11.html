<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 11<br><br>
</b>

Thirty spokes share the wheel's hub;<br>
It is the center hole that makes it useful.<br>
Shape clay into a vessel;<br>
It is the space within that makes it useful.<br>
Cut doors and windows for a room;<br>
It is the holes which make it useful.<br>
Therefore profit comes from what is there;<br>
Usefulness from what is not there.<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
