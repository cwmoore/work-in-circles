<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 28<br><br>
</b>

Know the strength of man,<br>
But keep a woman's care!<br>
Be the stream of the universe!<br>
Being the stream of the universe,<br>
Ever true and unswerving,<br>
Become as a little child once more.<br><br>

Know the white,<br>
But keep the black!<br>
Be an example to the world!<br>
Being an example to the world,<br>
Ever true and unwavering,<br>
Return to the infinite.<br><br>

Know honour,<br>
Yet keep humility!<br>
Be the valley of the universe!<br>
Being the valley of the universe,<br>
Ever true and resourceful,<br>
Return to the state of the uncarved block.<br><br>

When the block is carved, it becomes useful.<br>
When the sage uses it, he becomes the ruler.<br>
Thus, "A great tailor cuts little."<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
