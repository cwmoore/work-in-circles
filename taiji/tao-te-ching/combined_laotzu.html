<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 1<br><br>
</b>

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.<br>
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br>
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.<br>
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.<br>
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.<br>
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.<br>
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;this appears as darkness.<br>
Darkness within darkness.<br>
The gate to all mystery.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 2<br><br>
</b>

Under Heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.<br>
All can know good as good only because there is evil.<br><br>

Therefore having and not having arise together.<br>
Difficult and easy complement each other.<br>
Long and short contrast with each other;<br>
High and low rest upon each other;<br>
Voice and sound harmonize each other;<br>
Front and back follow one another.<br><br>

Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no talking.<br>
The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,<br>
Creating, yet not possessing,<br>
Working, yet not taking credit,<br>
Work is done, then forgotten.<br>
Therefore it lasts for ever.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 3<br><br>
</b>

Not exalting the gifted prevents quarrelling.<br>
Not collecting treasure prevents stealing.<br>
Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.<br><br>

The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.<br>
If people lack knowledge and desire,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;then intellectuals will not try to interfere.<br>
If nothing is done, then all will be well<br><br><br>

The Tao is an empty vessel; it is used, but never filled.<br>
Oh, unfathomable source of ten thousand things!<br>
Blunt the sharpness,<br>
Untangle the knot,<br>
Soften the glare,<br>
Merge with dust.<br>
Oh, hidden deep but ever present!<br>

Heaven and earth are ruthless;<br>
They see the ten thousand things as dummies.<br>
The wise are ruthless;<br>
They see the people as dummies.<br><br>

The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows.<br>
The shape changes but not the form;<br>
The more it moves, the more it yields.<br>
More words count less.<br>
Hold fast to the center.<br><br><br>

Heaven and Earth last for ever.<br>
Why do Heaven and Earth last for ever?<br>
They are unborn,<br>
So ever living.<br>
The sage stays behind, thus he is ahead.<br>
He is detached, thus at one with all.<br>
Through selfless action, he attains fulfillment.<br><br><br>

Better stop short than fill to the brim.<br>
Oversharpen the blade, and the edge will soon blunt.<br>
Amass a store of gold and jade, and no one can protect it.<br>
Claim wealth and titles, and disaster will follow.<br>
Retire when the work is done.<br>
This is the way of heaven.<br><br><br>

Carrying body and soul and embracing the one,<br>
Can you avoid separation?<br>
Attending fully and becoming supple,<br>
Can you be as a newborn babe?<br>
Washing and cleansing the primal vision,<br>
Can you be without stain?<br>
Loving all men and ruling the country,<br>
Can you be without cleverness?<br>
Opening and closing the gates of heaven,<br>
Can you play the role of woman?<br>
Understanding and being open to all things,<br>
Are you able to do nothing?<br>
Giving birth and nourishing,<br>
Bearing but not possessing,<br>
Working yet not taking credit,<br>
Leading yet not dominating,<br>
This is the Primal Virtue.<br><br><br>

It is the center hole that makes it useful.<br>
Shape clay into a vessel;<br>

Accept disgrace willingly.<br>
Accept misfortune as the human condition.<br><br>

What do you mean by "Accept disgrace willingly"?<br>
Accept being unimportant.<br>
Do not be concerned with loss and gain.<br>
This is called "accepting disgrace willingly."<br><br>

What do you mean by "Accept misfortune as the human condition"?<br>
Misfortune comes from having a body.<br>
Without a body, how could there be misfortune?<br><br>

Surrender yourself humbly; then you can be trusted to care for all things.<br>
Love the world as your own self; then you can truly care for all things.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 14<br><br>
</b>

Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form.<br>
Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound.<br>
Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible.<br>
These three are indefinable;<br>
Therefore they are joined in one.<br><br>

From above it is not bright;<br>
From below it is not dark:<br>
An unbroken thread beyond description.<br>
It returns to nothingness.<br>
The form of the formless,<br>
The image of the imageless,<br>
It is called indefinable and beyond imagination.<br><br>

Stand before it and there is no beginning.<br>
Follow it and there is no end.<br>
Stay with the ancient Tao,<br>
Move with the present.<br><br>

Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 15<br><br>
</b>

The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, responsive.<br>
The depth of their knowledge is unfathomable.<br>
Because it is unfathomable,<br>
All we can do is describe their appearance.<br>
Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream.<br>
Alert, like men aware of danger.<br>
Courteous, like visiting guests.<br>
Yielding, like ice about to melt.<br>
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.<br>
Hollow, like caves.<br>
Opaque, like muddy pools.<br><br>

Who can wait quietly while the mud settles?<br>
Who can remain still until the moment of action?<br>
Observers of the Tao do not seek fulfilment.<br>
Not seeking fulfillment, they are not swayed by desire for change.<br><br><br>

</b>

Empty yourself of everything.<br>
Let the mind rest at peace.<br>
The ten thousand things rise and fall while the Self watches their return.<br>
They grow and flourish and then return to the source.<br>
Returning to the source is stillness, which is the way of nature.<br>
The way of nature is unchanging.<br>
Knowing constancy is insight.<br>
Not knowing constancy leads to disaster.<br>
Knowing constancy, the mind is open.<br>
With an open mind, you will be openhearted.<br>
Being openhearted, you will act royally.<br>
Being royal, you will attain the divine.<br>
Being divine, you will be at one with the Tao.<br>
Being at one with the Tao is eternal.<br>
And though the body dies, the Tao will never pass away.<br><br><br>

The very highest is barely known by men.<br>

Give up ingenuity, renounce profit,<br>
And bandits and thieves will disappear.<br><br>

These three are outward forms alone; they are not sufficient in themselves.<br>

To see the simplicity,<br>

To cast off selfishness<br>

Give up learning, and put an end to your troubles.<br><br>

Is there a difference between good and evil?<br>
Must I fear what others fear? What nonsense!<br>
Other people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox.<br>
In spring some go to the park, and climb the terrace,<br>
But I alone am drifting not knowing where I am.<br>
Like a new-born babe before it learns to smile,<br>
I am alone, without a place to go.<br><br>

Other have more than they need, but I alone have nothing.<br>
I am a fool. Oh, yes! I am confused.<br>
Other men are clear and bright,<br>
But I alone am dim and weak.<br>
Other men are sharp and clever,<br>
But I alone am dull and stupid.<br>
Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea.<br>
Without direction, like the restless wind.<br><br>

Everyone else is busy,<br>
But I alone am aimless and depressed.<br>
I am different.<br>
I am nourished by the great mother.<br><br><br>

The greatest Virtue is to follow Tao and Tao alone.<br>
The Tao is elusive and intangible.<br>
Oh it is intangible and elusive, and yet within is image.<br>
Oh it is elusive and intangible, and yet within is form.<br>
Oh it is dim and dark, and yet within is essence.<br>
This essence is very real, and therein lies faith.<br>
From the very beginning until now its name has never been forgotten.<br>
Thus I perceive the creation.<br>
How do I know the ways of creation?<br>
Because of this.<br><br><br>

Yield and overcome;<br>
Bend and be straight;<br>
Empty and be full;<br>
Wear out and be new;<br>
Have little and gain;<br>
Have much and be confused.<br><br>

Therefore wise men embrace the one<br>
And set an example to all.<br>
Not putting on a display,<br>
They shine forth.<br>
Not justifying themselves,<br>
They are distinguished.<br>
Not boasting,<br>
They receive recognition.<br>
Not bragging,<br>
They never falter.<br>
They do not quarrel,<br>
So no one quarrels with them.<br>
Therefore the ancients say, 'Yield and overcome.'<br>
Is that an empty saying?<br>
Be really whole,<br>
And all things will come to you.<br><br><br>

Something mysteriously formed,<br>
Born before heaven and earth.<br>

Standing alone and unchanging,<br>
Ever present and in motion.<br>
Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.<br>
I do not know its name.<br>

For lack of a better word, I call it great.<br><br>

Being great, it flows.<br>
It flows far away.<br>
Having gone far, it returns.<br><br>

Therefore, "Tao is great;<br>
Heaven is great;<br>
Earth is great;<br>
The king is also great."<br>
These are the four great powers of the universe,<br>
And the king is one of them.<br><br>

Man follows the earth.<br>
Earth follows heaven.<br>
Heaven follows the Tao.<br>
Tao follows what is natural.<br><br><br>

</b>

Do you think you can take over the universe and improve it?<br>
I do not believe it can be done.<br><br>

The universe is sacred.<br>
You cannot improve it.<br>
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.<br>
If you try to hold it, you will lose it.<br><br>

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;<br>
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;<br>
Sometimes there is strength and sometimes weakness;<br>
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.<br><br>

Therefore the sage avoids extremes, excesses, and complacency.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 30<br><br>
</b>

Whenever you advise a ruler in the way of Tao,<br>
Counsel him not to use force to conquer the universe.<br>
For this would only cause resistance.<br>
Thorn bushes spring up wherever the army has passed.<br>
Lean years follow in the wake of a great war.<br>
Just do what needs to be done.<br>
Never take advantage of power.<br><br>

Achieve results,<br>
But never glory in them.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
But never boast.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
But never be proud.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
Because this is the natural way.<br>
Achieve results,<br>
But not through violence.<br><br>

Force is followed by loss of strength.<br>
This is not the way of Tao.<br>
That which goes against the Tao<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;comes to an early end.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 31<br><br>
</b>

Good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them.<br>
Therefore followers of the Tao never used them.<br>
The wise man prefers the left.<br>
The man of war prefers the right.<br><br>

Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools.<br>
He uses them only when he has no choice.<br>
Peace and quiet are dear to his heart.<br>
And victory no cause for rejoicing.<br>
If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing;<br>
If you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.<br><br>

On happy occasions precedence is given to the left,<br>
On sad occasions to the right.<br>
In the army the general stands on the left,<br>
The commander-in-chief on the right.<br>
This means that war is conducted like a funeral.<br>
When many people are being killed,<br>
They should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow.<br>
That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.<br><br><br>

The Tao is forever undefined.<br>
Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.<br>
If kings and lords could harness it,<br>
The ten thousand things would naturally obey.<br>
Heaven and earth would come together<br>
And gentle rain fall.<br>
Men would need no more instruction<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;and all things would take their course.<br><br>

Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.<br>
There are already enough names.<br>
One must know when to stop.<br>
Knowing when to stop averts trouble.<br>
Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.<br><br><br>

The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the right and to the left.<br>
The ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back.<br>
It fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim.<br><br>

It nourishes the ten thousand things,<br>
And yet is not their lord.<br>
It has no aim; it is very small.<br><br>

The ten thousand things return to it,<br>
Yet it is not their lord.<br>
It is very great.<br><br>

It does not show greatness,<br>
And is therefore really great.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 38<br><br>
</b>

A truly good man is not aware of his goodness,<br>
And is therefore good.<br>
A foolish man tries to be good,<br>
And is therefore not good.<br><br>

A truly good man does nothing,<br>
Yet nothing is left undone.<br>
A foolish man is always doing,<br>
Yet much remains to be done<br><br>

When a truly kind man does something, he leaves nothing undone.<br>
When a just man does something, he leaves a great deal to be done.<br>
When a disciplinarian does something and no one responds,<br>
He rolls up his sleeves in an attempt to enforce order<br><br>

Therefore when Tao is lost, there is goodness.<br>
When goodness is lost, there is kindness.<br>
When kindness is lost, there is justice.<br>
When justice is lost, there is ritual.<br>
Now ritual is the husk of faith and loyalty, the beginning of confusion.<br>
Knowledge of the future is only a flowery trapping of the Tao.<br>
It is the beginning of folly.<br><br>

Therefore the truly great man dwells on what is real<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;and not what is on the surface,<br>
On the fruit and not the flower,<br>
Therefore accept the one and reject the other.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 39<br><br>
</b>

These things from ancient times arise from one:<br>
The sky is whole and clear.<br>
The earth is whole and firm.<br>
The spirit is whole and strong.<br>
The valley is whole and full.<br>
The ten thousand things are whole and alive.<br>
Kings and lords are whole and the country is upright.<br>
All these are in virtue of wholeness.<br><br>

The clarity of the sky prevents it falling.<br>
The firmness of the earth prevents it splitting.<br>
The strength of the spirit prevents it being used up.<br>
The fullness of the valley prevents it running dry.<br>
The growth of the ten thousand things prevents them dying out.<br>
The leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;of the country.<br><br>

Therefore the humble is the root of the noble.<br>
The low is the foundation of the high.<br>
Princes and lords consider themselves<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"orphaned," "widowed," and "worthless."<br>
Do they not depend on being humble?<br><br>

Too much success is not an advantage.<br>
Do not tinkle like jade<br>
Or clatter like stone chimes.<br><br><br>

The wise student hears of the Tao and practises it diligently.<br>
The average student hears of the Tao and gives it thought now and again.<br>
The foolish student hears of the Tao and laughs aloud.<br>
If there were no laughter, the Tao would not be what it is.<br><br>

Hence it is said:<br>
The bright path seems dim;<br>
Going forward seems like retreat;<br>
The easy way seems hard;<br>
The highest Virtue seems empty;<br>
Great purity seems sullied;<br>
A wealth of Virtue seems inadequate;<br>
The strength of Virtue seems frail;<br>
Real Virtue seems unreal;<br>
The perfect square has no corners;<br>
Great talents ripen late;<br>
The highest notes are hard to hear;<br>
The greatest form has no shape.<br>
The Tao is hidden and without name.<br>
The Tao alone nourishes and brings everything to fulfillment.<br><br><br>

The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.<br>
They achieve harmony by combining these forces.<br><br>

Men hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless,"<br>
But this is how kings and lords describe themselves.<br><br>

For one gains by losing<br>

Great intelligence seems stupid.<br>
Great eloquence seems awkward.<br><br>

Movement overcomes cold.<br>
Stillness overcomes heat.<br>
Stillness and tranquility set things in order in the universe.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 46<br><br>
</b>

When the Tao is present in the universe,<br>
The horses haul manure.<br>
When the Tao is absent from the universe,<br>
War horses are bred outside the city.<br><br>

There is no greater sin than desire,<br>
No greater curse than discontent,<br>
No greater misfortune than wanting something for oneself.<br>
Therefore he who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.<br><br><br>

Without going outside, you may know the whole world.<br>
Without looking through the window, you may see the ways of heaven.<br>
The farther you go, the less you know.<br><br>

Thus the sage knows without travelling;<br>
He sees without looking;<br>
He works without doing.<br><br><br>

In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.<br>
In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped.<br><br>

Less and less is done<br>
Until non-action is achieved.<br>
When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.<br><br>

The world is ruled by letting things take their course.<br>
It cannot be ruled by interfering.<br><br><br>

He is aware of the need of others.<br><br>

I am good to people who are good.<br>
I am also good to people who are not good.<br>

Between birth and death,<br>
Three in ten are following life,<br>
Three in ten are following death,<br>
And men just passing from birth to death also number three in ten.<br>
Why is this so?<br>
Because they live their lives on the gross level.<br><br>

He who knows how to live can walk abroad<br>
Without fear of rhinoceros or tiger.<br>
He will not be wounded in battle.<br>
For in him rhinoceroses can find no place to thrust their horn,<br>
Tigers can find no place to use their claws,<br>
And weapons no place to pierce.<br>
Why is this so?
Because he has no place for death to enter.<br><br><br>

All things arise from Tao.<br>
They are nourished by Virtue.<br>
They are formed by matter.<br>
They are shaped by environment.<br>
Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honour Virtue.<br>
Respect of Tao and honour of Virtue are not demanded,<br>
But they are in the nature of things.<br><br>

Therefore all things arise from Tao.<br>
By Virtue they are nourished,<br>
Developed, cared for,<br>
Sheltered, comforted,<br>
Grown, and protected.<br>
Creating without claiming,<br>
Doing without taking credit,<br>
Guiding without interfering,<br>
This is Primal Virtue.<br><br><br>

The beginning of the universe<br>
Is the mother of all things.<br>
Knowing the mother, one also knows the sons.<br>
Knowing the sons, yet remaining in touch with the mother,<br>
Brings freedom from the fear of death.<br><br>

Keep your mouth shut,<br>
Guard your senses,<br>
And life is ever full.<br>
Open your mouth,<br>
Always be busy,<br>
And life is beyond hope.<br><br>

Seeing the small is insight;<br>
Yielding to force is strength.<br>
Using the outer light, return to insight,<br>
And in this way be saved from harm.<br>
This is learning constancy.<br><br><br>

If I have even just a little sense,<br>
I will walk on the main road and my only fear will be of straying from it.<br>
Keeping to the main road is easy,<br>
But people love to be sidetracked.<br><br>

When the court is arrayed in splendor,<br>
The fields are full of weeds,<br>
And the granaries are bare.<br>
Some wear are gorgeous clothes,<br>
Carry sharp swords,<br>
And indulge themselves with food and drink;<br>
They have more possessions than they can use.<br>
They are robber barons.<br>
This is certainly not the way of Tao.<br><br><br>

What is firmly established cannot be uprooted.<br>
What is firmly grasped cannot slip away.<br>
It will be honoured from generation to generation.<br><br>

Cultivate Virtue in yourself,<br>
And Virtue will be real.<br>
Cultivate it in the family,<br>
And Virtue will abound.<br>
Cultivate it in the village,<br>
And Virtue will grow.<br>
Cultivate it in the nation,<br>
And Virtue will be abundant.<br>
Cultivate it in the universe,<br>
And Virtue will be everywhere.<br><br>

Therefore look at the body as body;<br>
Look at the family as family;<br>
Look at the village as village;<br>
Look at the nation as nation;<br>
Look at the universe as universe.<br><br>

How do I know the universe is like this?<br>

He who is filled with Virtue is like a newborn child.<br>
Wasps and serpents will not sting him;<br>
Wild beasts will not pounce upon him;<br>
He will not be attacked by birds of prey.<br>
His bones are soft, his muscles weak,<br>
But his grip is firm.<br>
He has not experienced the union of man and woman, but is whole.<br>
His manhood is strong.<br>
He screams all day without becoming hoarse.<br>
This is perfect harmony.<br><br>

Knowing harmony is constancy.<br>
Knowing constancy is enlightenment.<br><br>

It is not wise to rush about.<br>
Controlling the breath causes strain.<br>
If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.<br>
This is not the way of Tao.<br>
Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.<br><br><br>

Restraint depends on giving up one's own ideas.<br>

If there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible.<br>
If nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.<br>
If a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler.<br>

The female overcomes the male with stillness,<br>
Lying low in stillness.<br><br>

Therefore if a great country gives way to a smaller country,<br>
It will conquer the smaller country.<br>
And if a small country submits to a great country,<br>
It can conquer the great country.<br>
Therefore those that would conquer must yield,<br>
And those that conquer do so because they yield.<br><br>

A great nation needs more people;<br>
A small country needs to serve.<br>
Each gets what it wants.<br>
It is fitting for a great nation to yield.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 62<br><br>
</b>

Tao is the source of the ten thousand things.<br>
It is the treasure of the good man, and the refuge of the bad.<br>
Sweet words can buy honour;<br>
Good deeds can gain respect.<br>
If a man is bad, do not abandon him.<br>
Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,<br>
Or the three officers of state installed,<br>
Do not send a gift of jade and a team of four horses,<br>
But remain still and offered the Tao.<br>
Why does everyone like the Tao so much at first?<br>
Isn't it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin?<br>
Therefore this is the greatest treasure of the universe.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 63<br><br>
</b>

Practice non-action.<br>
Work without doing.<br>
Taste the tasteless.<br>
Magnify the small, increase the few.<br>
Reward the bitterness with care.<br><br>

See simplicity in the complicated.<br>
Achieve greatness in little things.<br><br>

In the universe the difficult things are done as if they are easy.<br>
In the universe great acts are made up of small deeds.<br>
The sage does not attempt anything very big,<br>
And thus achieves greatness.<br><br>

Easy promises make for little trust.<br>
Taking things lightly results in great difficulty.<br>
Because the sage always confronts difficulties,<br>
He never experiences them.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 64<br><br>
</b>

Peace is easily maintained;<br>
Trouble is easily overcome before it starts.<br>
The brittle is easily shattered;<br>
The small is easily scattered.<br><br>

Deal with it before it happens.<br>
Set things in order before there is confusion.<br><br>

A tree as great as a man's embrace springs from a small shoot;<br>
A terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth;<br>
A journey of a thousand miles starts under one's feet.<br><br>

He who acts defeats his own purpose;<br>
He who grasps loses.<br>
The sage does no act, and so is not defeated.<br>
He does not grasp and therefore does not lose.<br><br>

People usually fail when they are on the verge of success.<br>
So give as much care to the end as to the beginning;<br>
Then there will be no failure.<br><br>

Therefore the sage seeks freedom from desire.<br>
He does not collect precious things.<br>
He learns not to hold on to ideas.<br>
He brings men back to what they have lost.<br>
He helps the ten thousand things find their own nature,<br>
But refrains from action.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 65<br><br>
</b>

In the beginning those who knew the Tao did not try to enlighten others,<br>
But kept them in the dark.<br>
Why is it so hard to rule?<br>
Because people are so clever.<br>
Rulers who try to use cleverness<br>
Cheat the country.<br>
Those who rule without cleverness<br>
Are a blessing to the land.<br>
These are the two alternatives.<br>
Understanding these is Primal Virtue.<br>
Primal Virtue is deep and far.<br>
It leads all things back<br>
Toward the great oneness.<br><br><br>

Why is the sea king of a hundred streams?<br>
Because it lies below them.<br>
Therefore it is the king of a hundred streams.<br><br>

If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility.<br>
If he would lead them, he must follow behind.<br>
In this way when the sage rules, the people will not feel oppressed;<br>
When he stands before them, they will not be harmed.<br>
The whole world will support him and will not tire of him.<br><br>

Because he does not compete,<br>
He does not meet competition.<br><br><br>

<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 67<br><br>
</b>

Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare.<br>
Because it is great, it seems different.<br>
If it were not different, it would have vanished long ago.<br><br>

I have three treasures which I hold and keep.<br>
The first is mercy; the second is economy;<br>
The third is daring not to be ahead of others.<br>
From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;<br>
From humility comes leadership.<br><br>

Nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;<br>
They abandon economy, but try to be generous;<br>
They do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.<br>
This is certain death.<br><br>

Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.<br>
It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.<br><br><br>

There is a saying amongst soldiers:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot.<br><br>

This is called marching without appearing to move,<br>
Rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm,<br>
Capturing the enemy without attacking,<br>
Being armed without weapons.<br><br>

There is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy.<br>
By underestimating the enemy, I almost lose what I value.<br><br>

Therefore when the battle is joined,<br>
The underdog will win.<br><br><br>

My words have ancient beginnings.<br>

If the string is too long, it is shortened;<br>
If there is not enough, it is made longer.<br><br>

The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much<br>

What man has more than enough and gives it to the world?<br>
Only the man of Tao.<br><br>

Therefore the sage works without recognition.<br>
He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it.<br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 78<br><br>
</b>

Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br>
Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;<br>
It has no equal.<br>
The weak can overcome the strong;<br>
The supple can overcome the stiff.<br>
Under heaven everyone knows this,<br>
Yet no one puts it into practice.<br>
Therefore the sage says:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;is fit to rule them.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;to be king of the universe.<br>
The truth often seems paradoxical.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 79<br><br>
</b>

After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.<br>
What can one do about it?<br>
Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain<br>
But does not exact his due.<br>
A man of Virtue performs his part,<br>
But a man without Virtue requires others to fulfil their obligations.<br>
The Tao of heaven is impartial.<br>
It stays with good men all the time.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 80<br><br>
</b>

A small country has fewer people.<br>
Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;than man, they are not needed.<br>
The people take death seriously and do not travel far.<br>
Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.<br>
Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.<br>
Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.<br>
Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;their homes secure;<br>
They are happy in their ways.<br>
Though they live within sight of their neighbors,<br>
And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,<br>
Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.<br><br><br>

Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 81<br><br>
</b>

Truthful words are not beautiful.<br>
Beautiful words are not truthful.<br>
Good men do not argue.<br>
Those who argue are not good.<br>
Those who know are not learned.<br>
The learned do not know.<br><br>

The sage never tries to store things up.<br>
The more he does for others, the more he has.<br>
The more he gives to others, the greater his abundance.<br>
The Tao of heaven is pointed but does no harm.<br>
The Tao of the sage is work without effort.<br><br><br>
