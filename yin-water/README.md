There was an observation I made about the energy transferring to a water surface and creating waves, and I thought that a simple animation might be illuminating.

I have a sequence of drawings on graph paper showing the process with square cells that begins like this:

        0:
        |+| |
        | |-|

        1:
        | |+|
        |-| |

        2:
        |-| |
        | |+|

        3:
        | |-|
        |+| |

...and results in a yin-yang symbol that I see as integral to understanding wave action.

This forms a basis of my "theory of everything" by means of computational physics which I do not understand and which I am currently in no position to promote or test.

My hopes in this line of thought are to secure some guidance or mentorship and funds to continue my education and research, though, alas, my personal history is built on an unsound basis.
