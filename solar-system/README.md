# Solar System AKA 10,000 Things

## From *Work In Circles*

From the digital series Work In Circles, "Solar System" combines Taoism with space and binary time to abstractly represent a development of reality in deterministic gravitational-wave metaphors.

Interesting to note that the source data for the initial radii and rotational velocities were based from NASA data about the planets in our Solar System, yet the complexities of the images elicit visual interest more reserved for a micro scale.

Each image in the ongoing generative process is itself a still artwork, rendering many thousands of unique original works of art.

Additionally, at the pixel densities computed through to multiple decimal places, Moire Patterns in the visual interactions between the work and the viewers' screen-specifications further uniquely determine that representation.

Later iterations of the generative procedure reveal the patterns left in deep space by the gravitational motions of the solar system as a selected fractal of the galaxy and beyond, perhaps to the essential substrates of existence.
