# README

There was an observation I made about the energy transferring to a water surface and creating waves, and I though that a simple animation might illuminating.

I have a sequence of drawings showing the process with square cells.

This fits into my theory of everything by means of computational physics which I do noit understand and which I am currently in no position to promote or test.

My hopes in this line of thought are to secure some guidance or mentorship and funds to continue my education and research, though, alas, my personal history is built on an unsound basis.
