<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 63<br><br>
</b>

Practice non-action.<br>
Work without doing.<br>
Taste the tasteless.<br>
Magnify the small, increase the few.<br>
Reward the bitterness with care.<br><br>

See simplicity in the complicated.<br>
Achieve greatness in little things.<br><br>

In the universe the difficult things are done as if they are easy.<br>
In the universe great acts are made up of small deeds.<br>
The sage does not attempt anything very big,<br>
And thus achieves greatness.<br><br>

Easy promises make for little trust.<br>
Taking things lightly results in great difficulty.<br>
Because the sage always confronts difficulties,<br>
He never experiences them.<br><br><br>
