<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 31<br><br>
</b>

Good weapons are instruments of fear; all creatures hate them.<br>
Therefore followers of the Tao never used them.<br>
The wise man prefers the left.<br>
The man of war prefers the right.<br><br>

Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools.<br>
He uses them only when he has no choice.<br>
Peace and quiet are dear to his heart.<br>
And victory no cause for rejoicing.<br>
If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing;<br>
If you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.<br><br>

On happy occasions precedence is given to the left,<br>
On sad occasions to the right.<br>
In the army the general stands on the left,<br>
The commander-in-chief on the right.<br>
This means that war is conducted like a funeral.<br>
When many people are being killed,<br>
They should be mourned in heartfelt sorrow.<br>
That is why a victory must be observed like a funeral.<br><br><br>
