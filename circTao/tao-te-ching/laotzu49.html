<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 49<br><br>
</b>

The sage has no mind of his own.<br>
He is aware of the need of others.<br><br>

I am good to people who are good.<br>
I am also good to people who are not good.<br>
Because Virtue is goodness.<br>
I have faith in people who are faithful.<br>
I also have faith in people who are not faithful.<br>
Because Virtue is faithfulness.<br><br>

The sage is shy and humble - to the world he seems confusing.<br>
Men look to him and listen.<br>
He behaves like a little child.<br><br><br>
