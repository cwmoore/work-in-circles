<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 21<br><br>
</b>

The greatest Virtue is to follow Tao and Tao alone.<br>
The Tao is elusive and intangible.<br>
Oh it is intangible and elusive, and yet within is image.<br>
Oh it is elusive and intangible, and yet within is form.<br>
Oh it is dim and dark, and yet within is essence.<br>
This essence is very real, and therein lies faith.<br>
From the very beginning until now its name has never been forgotten.<br>
Thus I perceive the creation.<br>
How do I know the ways of creation?<br>
Because of this.<br><br><br>
