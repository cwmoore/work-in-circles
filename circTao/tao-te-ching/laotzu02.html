<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 2<br><br>
</b>

Under Heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.<br>
All can know good as good only because there is evil.<br><br>

Therefore having and not having arise together.<br>
Difficult and easy complement each other.<br>
Long and short contrast with each other;<br>
High and low rest upon each other;<br>
Voice and sound harmonize each other;<br>
Front and back follow one another.<br><br>

Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no talking.<br>
The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,<br>
Creating, yet not possessing,<br>
Working, yet not taking credit,<br>
Work is done, then forgotten.<br>
Therefore it lasts for ever.<br><br><br>
