Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 39<br><br>
</b>

These things from ancient times arise from one:<br>
The sky is whole and clear.<br>
The earth is whole and firm.<br>
The spirit is whole and strong.<br>
The valley is whole and full.<br>
The ten thousand things are whole and alive.<br>
Kings and lords are whole and the country is upright.<br>
All these are in virtue of wholeness.<br><br>

The clarity of the sky prevents it falling.<br>
The firmness of the earth prevents it splitting.<br>
The strength of the spirit prevents it being used up.<br>
The fullness of the valley prevents it running dry.<br>
The growth of the ten thousand things prevents them dying out.<br>
The leadership of kings and lords prevents the downfall<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;of the country.<br><br>

Therefore the humble is the root of the noble.<br>
The low is the foundation of the high.<br>
Princes and lords consider themselves<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"orphaned," "widowed," and "worthless."<br>
Do they not depend on being humble?<br><br>

Too much success is not an advantage.<br>
Do not tinkle like jade<br>
Or clatter like stone chimes.<br><br><br>
