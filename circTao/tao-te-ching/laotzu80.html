<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 80<br><br>
</b>

A small country has fewer people.<br>
Though there are machines that can work ten to a hundred times faster<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;than man, they are not needed.<br>
The people take death seriously and do not travel far.<br>
Though they have boats and carriages, no on uses them.<br>
Though they have armor and weapons, no one displays them.<br>
Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.<br>
Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;their homes secure;<br>
They are happy in their ways.<br>
Though they live within sight of their neighbors,<br>
And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,<br>
Yet they leave each other in peace while they grow old and die.<br><br><br>
