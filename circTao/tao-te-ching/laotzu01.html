Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 1<br><br>
</b>

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.<br>
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br>
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.<br>
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.<br>
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.<br>
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.<br>
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;this appears as darkness.<br>
Darkness within darkness.<br>
The gate to all mystery.<br><br><br>
