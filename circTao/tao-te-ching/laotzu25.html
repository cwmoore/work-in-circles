<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 25<br><br>
</b>

Something mysteriously formed,<br>
Born before heaven and earth.<br>
In the silence and the void,<br>
Standing alone and unchanging,<br>
Ever present and in motion.<br>
Perhaps it is the mother of ten thousand things.<br>
I do not know its name.<br>
Call it Tao.<br>
For lack of a better word, I call it great.<br><br>

Being great, it flows.<br>
It flows far away.<br>
Having gone far, it returns.<br><br>

Therefore, "Tao is great;<br>
Heaven is great;<br>
Earth is great;<br>
The king is also great."<br>
These are the four great powers of the universe,<br>
And the king is one of them.<br><br>

Man follows the earth.<br>
Earth follows heaven.<br>
Heaven follows the Tao.<br>
Tao follows what is natural.<br><br><br>
