Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 73<br><br>
</b>

A brave and passionate man will kill or be killed.<br>
A brave and calm man will always preserve life.<br>
Of these two, which is good and which is harmful?<br>
Some things are not favoured by heaven. Who knows why?<br>
Even the sage is unsure of this.<br><br>

The Tao of heaven does not strive, and yet it overcomes.<br>
It does not speak, and yet is answered.<br>
It does not ask, yet is supplied with all its needs.<br>
It seems at ease, and yet it follows a plan.<br><br>

Heaven's net casts wide.<br>
Though its meshes are coarse, nothing slips through.<br><br><br>
