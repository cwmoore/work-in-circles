<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 64<br><br>
</b>

Peace is easily maintained;<br>
Trouble is easily overcome before it starts.<br>
The brittle is easily shattered;<br>
The small is easily scattered.<br><br>

Deal with it before it happens.<br>
Set things in order before there is confusion.<br><br>

A tree as great as a man's embrace springs from a small shoot;<br>
A terrace nine stories high begins with a pile of earth;<br>
A journey of a thousand miles starts under one's feet.<br><br>

He who acts defeats his own purpose;<br>
He who grasps loses.<br>
The sage does no act, and so is not defeated.<br>
He does not grasp and therefore does not lose.<br><br>

People usually fail when they are on the verge of success.<br>
So give as much care to the end as to the beginning;<br>
Then there will be no failure.<br><br>

Therefore the sage seeks freedom from desire.<br>
He does not collect precious things.<br>
He learns not to hold on to ideas.<br>
He brings men back to what they have lost.<br>
He helps the ten thousand things find their own nature,<br>
But refrains from action.<br><br><br>
