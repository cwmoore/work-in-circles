<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 51<br><br>
</b>

All things arise from Tao.<br>
They are nourished by Virtue.<br>
They are formed by matter.<br>
They are shaped by environment.<br>
Thus the ten thousand things all respect Tao and honour Virtue.<br>
Respect of Tao and honour of Virtue are not demanded,<br>
But they are in the nature of things.<br><br>

Therefore all things arise from Tao.<br>
By Virtue they are nourished,<br>
Developed, cared for,<br>
Sheltered, comforted,<br>
Grown, and protected.<br>
Creating without claiming,<br>
Doing without taking credit,<br>
Guiding without interfering,<br>
This is Primal Virtue.<br><br><br>
