<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 53<br><br>
</b>

If I have even just a little sense,<br>
I will walk on the main road and my only fear will be of straying from it.<br>
Keeping to the main road is easy,<br>
But people love to be sidetracked.<br><br>

When the court is arrayed in splendor,<br>
The fields are full of weeds,<br>
And the granaries are bare.<br>
Some wear are gorgeous clothes,<br>
Carry sharp swords,<br>
And indulge themselves with food and drink;<br>
They have more possessions than they can use.<br>
They are robber barons.<br>
This is certainly not the way of Tao.<br><br><br>
