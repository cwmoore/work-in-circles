Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 32<br><br>
</b>

The Tao is forever undefined.<br>
Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.<br>
If kings and lords could harness it,<br>
The ten thousand things would naturally obey.<br>
Heaven and earth would come together<br>
And gentle rain fall.<br>
Men would need no more instruction<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;and all things would take their course.<br><br>

Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.<br>
There are already enough names.<br>
One must know when to stop.<br>
Knowing when to stop averts trouble.<br>
Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.<br><br><br>
