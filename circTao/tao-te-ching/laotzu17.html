<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 17<br><br>
</b>

The very highest is barely known by men.<br>
Then comes that which they know and love,<br>
Then that which is feared,<br>
Then that which is despised.<br><br>

He who does not trust enough will not be trusted.<br><br>

When actions are performed<br>
Without unnecessary speech,<br>
People say, "We did it!"<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
