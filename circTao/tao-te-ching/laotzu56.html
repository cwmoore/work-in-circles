<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 56<br><br>
</b>

Those who know do not talk.<br>
Those who talk do not know.<br><br>

Keep your mouth closed.<br>
Guard your senses.<br>
Temper your sharpness.<br>
Simplify your problems.<br>
Mask your brightness.<br>
Be at one with the dust of the earth.<br>
This is primal union.<br><br>

He who has achieved this state<br>
Is unconcerned with friends and enemies,<br>
With good and harm, with honour and disgrace.<br>
This therefore is the highest state of man.<br><br><br>

(translation by <a href="key.html#gfje">Gia-fu Feng and Jane English</a>)<br><br>
