<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 42<br><br>
</b>

The Tao begot one.<br>
One begot two.<br>
Two begot three.<br>
And three begot the ten thousand things.<br><br>

The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.<br>
They achieve harmony by combining these forces.<br><br>

Men hate to be "orphaned," "widowed," or "worthless,"<br>
But this is how kings and lords describe themselves.<br><br>

For one gains by losing<br>
And loses by gaining.<br><br>

What others teach, I also teach; that is:<br>
"A violent man will die a violent death!"<br>
This will be the essence of my teaching.<br><br><br>
