<b>
Tao Te Ching - Lao Tzu - chapter 76<br><br>
</b>

A man is born gentle and weak.<br>
At his death he is hard and stiff.<br>
Green plants are tender and filled with sap.<br>
At their death they are withered and dry.<br><br>

Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.<br>
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.<br><br>

Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.<br>
A tree that is unbending is easily broken.<br><br>

The hard and strong will fall.<br>
The soft and weak will overcome.<br><br><br>
